This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhier17/care-pulse.git
cd care-pulse
```

**Installation**

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
#APPWRITE
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
PROJECT_ID=
API_KEY=
DATABASE_ID=
PATIENT_COLLECTION_ID=
APPOINTMENT_COLLECTION_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_ID=

NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSKEY=111111
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Appwrite credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up on the [Appwrite website](https://appwrite.io/).

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
